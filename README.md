# HACK ASM Assembler and Disassembler
"""DISCLAIMER: both the assembler and disassembler remove comments in the files the create, not the files parsed
First, Python must be installed in order to use the program as well as an Python IDE, running the program can also be done through using the terminal.

Once Python is installed you will now be able to assemble .asm files or disassemble .hack files

Be sure to place all of the python .py files into a single folder that can be accessed

To assemble, place the .asm file in the same folder as the python program files are in.
Then, open up your python IDE and open the terminal. In the terminal write specifically in this format where {file_name} is the name of your file:

    python assembler.py {file name}.asm

Then press enter.

If the program is assembled then the console should output a success message with the .hack file name

To disassemble, place the .hack file in the folder with all of the python files.
Then, open up you python IDE and open up the terminal.

In the terminal write specifically in this format where {file_name} is the name of your file:

    python disassembler.py {file name}.hack

If the program is disassembled then the console should output a success message with the .asm file name

An IDE is not necessary to run the program if you are able to control directories to the folder with all of the python files through the terminal

After cd-ing, you could then follow the same instructions and write the same commands in terminal and the same output should work
